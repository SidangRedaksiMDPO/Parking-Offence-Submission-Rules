Rules of Submission For Submitting Parking Offences

1. Plate number must be visible.

2. Location must be precise, using Google Maps is recommended.

3. Date/Time is required.

4. Wide shots are mostly preferred, with proper descriptions. The clearer and clarity you take and explain, the better.

5. Photos or videos of any official/authority/emergency vehicles (for example: PDRM/Bomba/Military/Ambulance/YBs/Diplomats including but not limited to, vehicles made known to us as VVIPs are not accepted. We assume they are engaged in official/emergency duties, thus parking their vehicles in such manner. Let the relevant authorities deal with their own department.

6. Photos or videos taken at any or near religious centres such as mosques, temples, churches and the equivalent, are rejected.

7. For cases of double/triple/multiple parking shots that are blocking other vehicles, at least one image of photo taken at the offending car's dashboard to verify if a contact number is present or not.

8. For cases of any driver abusing OKU parkings, at least two photos are required. One photo must show dashboard/front windscreen to verify if the driver has OKU sticker, another photo must show the back of the car if to verify the driver has OKU sticker.

9. Any submissions which are assumed taken by driver (a.k.a. driver's point of view) by using handphone will be rejected. However, submissions taken by passenger (a.k.a. passenger's point of view) are accepted. We have team of professional photographers and videographers who can able to distinguish whether it was taken by passenger or a driver, so do be honest.

10. Before submitting, ask yourself these questions.

    Is the owner still present in, or around their vehicle?
    Have you attempted to confront them in any way, ie. verbal, gestures, or signs?
    If you have spoken to them, did they repark / relocate their vehicle? If they did not, what was their attitude / reaction towards you?
    Is the vehicle in any way stalled, broken down, or in any emergencies? Is the hazard lights on and safety triangle placed?
    If the vehicle is parked at an OKU spot, is an OKU sticker / card visibly displayed? Is it a public or private premise where the OKU spots are located?
    Did the double / triple / multiple parker leave a contact number? Have you attempted to contact them if your vehicle is blocked? How long did it take, and what was their reply / attitude?
    If it's a bike on a car spot, are bike parkings provided in that area? Are they delivery riders merely doing drop off / pick up? Are they long?

If you know the answers to the above, you are good to go.

11. Shoot at your own risk. Shoot safe. Be safe. Our page will not be liable for any injuries / deaths that may have caused you in any way during your photo/video takings. If you ever felt threaten in any way during the photoshoots/videoshoots, police is just a dial away.
